CSS + Bootstrap

I don't have projects to display yet so I used my picture as a placeholder on the portfoli page. When I originally 
made my grid and placed the pcitures inside of them I had a massive white space below that was driving me crazy. I originally
had the width="auto" and height="x%" when I flipped them so that the height="auto" it got rid of the white space underneath and fit to the page.
This also allowed to me to dial in the sizing for smaller screen devices.


Couldn't figure out how to make the collapsable menu work on the navbar so I deleted it's code out of <nav></nav>. 
The links go to the right as the screen gets smaller although I wish they would stay on the left. Tried different codes and deleting some of the tags
but couldn't understand why they move. Hopefully I will as I learn more about CSS and designing nav bars.

The submit button on the contact sheet does not yet work as I do not yet know how to link a e-mail with the mail.php
I had a hard time finding a contact page/card on bootstrap but found several good ones on mdbootstrap.com
